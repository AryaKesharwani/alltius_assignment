Fixed Deposit Options - Angel One Source: https:  www.angelone.in support fixed-deposits fixed-deposit-options     What is a fixed deposit and why should I invest? A fixed deposit (FD) is a popular and safe investment option in India. You invest a lump sum of money at an agreed interest rate and receive the amount along with interest upon maturity. The interest rates are fixed, higher than a regular savings account, and the investment is protected from market fluctuations. Is it safe to invest in an FD? Yes, FDs are one of the safest investment options. Unlike market-led investments where returns fluctuate, the returns on an FD are fixed at the time of investment."

    "content": "Account Verification - Angel One Source: https: www.angelone.in support hindi fixed-deposits Why do I need to verify my mobile number? Verifying your mobile number helps us create a secure account for you, ensuring a smooth app experience and the safety of your account. Can I continue if the mobile number linked to my bank is different from the one registered with the app? No, your details, including your mobile number, must match those verified by our banking partner. A mismatch will result in your application being rejected by the bank. Why are permissions to send SMS and access phone state required? These permissions are needed to verify your mobile number by sending an SMS. Rest assured, these permissions are used solely for verification purposes. Can I link any SIM for FD purchase if I have a dual SIM phone? Yes, you can. However, we recommend using the SIM registered with your bank account for authentication. Can I retry the registration if it was not successful earlier?"

Ensure you use the SIM linked to your bank account for authentication. Can I invest in FD if I do not have a PAN? No, currently, we only process fixed deposit requests for individuals with an active PAN. Why is my PAN not getting verified? For booking fixed deposits, we need to verify your PAN with the regulated authorities. If there is a mismatch, the booking cannot be completed. What should I do if the name shown against my PAN is incorrect and I can t update it? The name linked to your PAN should be accurate for successful identity verification and KYC purposes. Please update your name to match your PAN. Why is my Aadhar required? Aadhar is mandatory for identification and KYC setup for your account, necessary for processing your FD request. Do I need a physical copy of my Aadhar? No, a physical copy is not required."

Your position could have been squared off due to any of the below reasons:   Intraday trades will auto squared off at 3:15 pm for the Cash segment and at 3:20 for the F O segment. Intraday trades will be squared off if you lose 80  of your Available Margin. When you don t maintain the minimum required margin in your account your shares will be squared off 4 days after the shortfall occurs. When your shares bought using Margin are down by more than 50  of your fund balance, square-off will be done on the next trading day. Shares bought under Margin Product need to be fully paid or pledged, failing which the shared will be squared off after 7 days."

It may happen if you have a pending Stop-Loss (SL) or an exit order already. With an already pending stop-loss or exit order, you will need extra funds to be able to place a duplicate SL exit order. If you do not have this extra fund in your account, then your duplicate exit order will get rejected. That s why we inform you while exiting if there s a Pending SL exit order against a position, to avoid any duplicate orders and rejections. My Stop-Loss (SL) order was triggered but it did not get executed. Why did this happen? There could be 2 major reasons behind this: The asset may be lacking a buyer seller at the defined stop-loss limit price due to a lack of market depth."

For example: Let s say there are 50 buyers and 100 sellers who are waiting to trade on a scrip at  90. Upon reaching  90, the first 50 sellers  orders will be executed, and the remaining 50 sellers will have to wait for new buyers. In case you are one of those remaining 50 sellers, your sell order will remain pending if there are no corresponding buyers and vice versa. The price movement during high volatility does not fulfill certain criteria e.g. suppose you have placed a sell stop-loss with trigger Price at  100 and limit price at  100. Now imagine that the LTP touched  100 (here, the SL would be triggered) and quickly went below  100 due to high volatility. The limit price of  100 means the stop-loss order would get executed at only  100 or more."

Now this order will be pending as price is below Rs 100 and execution will happen only when price has reached or crossed Rs 100. Hence your stop-loss order was not executed. Due to this reason, we recommend keeping a sufficient gap between the trigger price and limit price to increase the chances of Stop Loss execution during high volatility. Note: In order to increase the chances of execution, we keep the default value of the limit price 2 ticks away from the trigger price. This is done so that if the LTP moves rapidly after triggering the order, the limit price shouldn t be a hindrance and the order should still get executed. Also, if you change the pre-set limit price and bring it closer to the Trigger Price, the chances of execution can reduce in cases of volatility.

As a result, such momentary price fluctuations are not seen anywhere. Price matching and execution of the orders is done by the Exchanges and not the Broker. What is Stop Loss? Stop-loss is a tool that investors use to minimise the loss in a trade.

A Trailing Stop-loss is an order that lets you set a maximum value or percentage of loss you can incur on a trade. If the securiy price rises or falls in your favour, the trigger price jumps with it at the set value or percentage. If the security price rises or falls against you, the trigger price stays in place depending on the nature of the order. How does a Stop-loss get triggered? Stop-loss can be your real saviour during a volatile market condition. A price level set at the beginning of the trade allows traders to close their position automatically when the stop-loss is reached. Squaring off takes place at the next price available at the trigger price level and helps limit losses. What is the 1  rule of trading?
